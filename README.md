This repository contains the code and data necessary for our LfN project: Probability of collaboration between authors of research papers.

Abstracts contains two folders: cit-HepTh-abstracts, with all the papers, and data_abstracts, with all the data used to build the graph without extracting it from the papers.

Scopus contains AI_Scopus.csv, a file that contains all data of the papers, and data_scopus, with all the data used to build the graph without extracting it from the csv file.

The rest of the files are the code used for the graph extraction or the training of the model, depending on the file name.
